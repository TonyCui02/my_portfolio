            I currently intern at the Auckland Bioengineering institute, responsible for a tour authoring tool that
            allows tour guides to create and manage virtual 360 tours.

            I'm passionate about using an interdisciplinary approach to solving problems, it is particularly exciting to see my solutions
            make a difference in one's life.

            When I'm not coding, I enjoy sketching and graphic design. Sometimes I play pop or classical music on my piano too.
