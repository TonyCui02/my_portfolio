          <p>
            Final year Software Engineering student at the University Of Auckland.

          <p>
            I interned at EY as a technology consultant where I gained an understanding of the overall software development lifecycle
            and learnt to communicate with non technical clients. Prior to this, I was a software engineering intern at EROAD
            where I deepened my understanding of microservices development in Java and Spring Boot.

          <p>
            I'm passionate about using an interdisciplinary approach to solving problems, it is particularly exciting to see my solutions
            make a difference in one's life. 
          </p>

            When I'm not coding, I enjoy sketching and graphic design. Sometimes I play pop or classical music on my piano too.
